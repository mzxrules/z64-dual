Rom G0 is Ocarina of Time
Rom G1 is Majora's Mask

At ROM address 3FFF0000 (both uncompressed and compressed) is a 
structure containing the following:
0x0000 // G1 0x40 byte rom header
0x0040 // G0 dmadata
0x6240 // G1 dmadata

makerom.asm contains the rom entrypoint code. This branches into 
a payload replacing rom G0's original dmadata, which is part of the
first megabyte of the rom loaded into memory after the pifrom boot.
A temporary 0x2000 byte stack is allocated to 80780000

boot.asm (top level) contains the logic used determine which
game to boot into. It copies itself into address 80700000 and then
jumps inside, processing the rom select logic. Copying allows it
to swap into MM if necessary
